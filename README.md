# My Personal Site

### well this is awkward?
Here is everything behind my personal site. It follows my design philosophy of simplicity
and efficiency and uses [nothing but html and css](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/).
Took me many an hours of learning frameworks to learn that I really don't need to be using them...

The site is deployed to an s3 bucket via github actions which is then delivered to you
through aws CloudFront.

cheers! :D
