# My Personal Site

### well this is awkward?
Here is everything behind my personal site. It follows my design philosophy of simplicity
and efficiency and uses [nothing but html and css](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/).
Took me many hours of learning frameworks to learn that I really don't need to be using them...

The site is deployed to an s3 bucket via github actions which is then delivered to you
through aws CloudFront. Hope you enjoy the insider look.

cheers! :D
